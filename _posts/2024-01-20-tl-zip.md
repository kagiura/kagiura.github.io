> song tl of "ปิดปาก / Kiss on the lips" th > en!

Those pair of eyes look right at me
see right through you into the deepening void
Perhaps I might turn that reflection mine
only me within your eyes as they shine
—would you like?

Captivating looks aside, I'm not quite sure why
theres no life within that dark cold stare
Take my hand, reach out to me and you'll see
a world you could only dream—vibrant and full of life

\* Let me zip you right up, unshackle everything
Let me rip all the nightmares you had out of your mind
Until dawn, no need to keep it all,
leave your thoughts and lets go on a long journey
I'm all yours—quench your thirst
and we'll go on a trip to ecstasy
Turn this dreadful world into a hazy dream
You'll be fine with me right by your side
now leave everything behind
satiate your true desires

All the words you like to say sounds melodious
pierce right through me;
I wonder if it was sincere or specious
For all you know, maybe I could take that glow
turn it to a genuine show, if you'd like

No secret words, no awful jokes
no requirements to bespoke
Just allow me in the know, be in your care
When snow falls I'll be your warmth
When lonely I will be there
With you accepting me,
you'll get the sympathy you desire

You probably know that you're playing with fire
It would be less than ideal
if it ends and goes awry
But don't try to hide
look at me, in the eyes
maybe just once would be fine?

Indulge in me, I'm your exclusive fantasy
One small sip, it wouldn't hurt much,
put your mind at ease
Those pinkish blush on your cheeks,
heart racing one-twenty three
Your focus withering, it's blending with mine

Sweet words come quite dry
That gaze looking into me
The breathless allure
Do you realise?
For all you know, maybe I could take that glow
turn it to a genuine show, if you'd like

### Notes

This song just caught me by surprise one day through YouTube mix and I immediately fell in love with it haha. The meaning can be interpreted so many ways and through this translation I kinda leaned in on "toxic relationship/codependency" vibes? Though theres other ways to interpret the song too. Translation is quite liberal by the way, so it probably won't match up 1-to-1 with the og song. Was a fun translation to try nevertheless!
