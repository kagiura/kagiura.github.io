> update on where i've been, and the future of @findermao

first off, thanks for the continued support. i'm not sure if i even have an audience anymore, but i figured i'd drop an update after disappearing almost completely for so long. (reminder that i actually haven't, i just moved to @fudanshipgone. see me there!)

firstly, to clarify, it is indeed both that i am just quite busy with university, and also that my interest in enstars has mostly waned by now. i haven't kept up with any of the recent updates, nor have i really felt the need to catch up and do so. i haven't caught up at all with the recent events either, so i'm not going to be suggesting anything outright, but do make sure to do your research and understand the depth of the situation going onâ€”is all i can ask for.

either way, many other things have caught my interest along the way. other series like nijisanji, 18trip, bl comics, or more recently idolish7 have been on my mind a lot. these have much less fandom work to do in terms of coding/design work, so i've mostly moved to the sidelines and supported them more as a normal fan this time. i find it more enjoyable here, so unless anything changes, i'll probably stay here for the foreseeable future.

i know there's been a lot of new exciting creators joining into the various sides of these fandoms recently, and i definitely give them all my support. i'm always glad when i hear that people still remember some of my work, and if any of you have felt inspired by it in some way, i can't say anything but that i'm glad that it did that way. i'm always surprised to hear people mention they knew me in some shape or form, and somehow it still happens to this day ?? @findermao started when i was in high school, so its kind of amazing to look back and realize how much people my silly little projects reached. i'm sorry if i can't really make any new big flashy projects anymore, but i hope you continue to support those that do so.

as for the @findermao account, i think i'll slowly divest it from being enstars-centric to being a more personal account i post my work on. i still want to go back to streaming and creating content as me some day, but the twitter algorithm doesn't favor suddenly shifting gears so strongly, so i might just leave it as an occasional hobby for now. i'll also probably rework my website in the coming months, as i want it to more closely reflect my recent interests.

semi-relatedly, i won't be abandoning any of my existing projects too. makotools is a website i strongly cherish, as by now i've spent years of my life on it, and it's brought me a lot of friendships and allowed me to learn so much from working on it. aside from that, i do believe it is important that the fandom can retain a trustworthy source of information not associated to any official resources, and thus, as long as the fandom wiki stays alive, makotools will too; or at least, i will do my best to try keep it that way.

another project you may have heard of is reiou, my oissu x tumblr solution for creating translation-oriented websites from ground up. i'm excited to announce that the project is mostly done, and i'm working on getting translators up to speed with where the project is heading. due to its sheer scale, i can't assure you that this project will be fully free of charge to use like i usually do, but i'll be exploring ways to keep it simple for everyone while being sustainable for me, as a project that requires much more attention and work than everything else i've done before. if this sounds interesting to you as a translator, feel free to reach out too! i don't think it'll cause as much as a splash as back when oissu was released, but i hope it can make someone's reading experience a little better, if at all.

;;;

frankly, at this point, i'm not sure if anyone would've read this far, but i just want to thank you everyone for the past 3-4 years that i've been here. @findermao was one of the few times in my life that i could reach thousands of people at once, and it gave me a once-in-a-lifetime experience that changed me as a person growing up. i owe a lot of my irl achievements to you all, and it's been an honor to create things for the fandom, that i hope was useful in some way to everyone at that point. 

i'll still be hanging around watching from the sidelines, but please don't expect much from this account anymore, and feel free to unfollow / distance yourself if it works out better for your timeline. again, thank you for your continued support, and i hope you have a great year ahead of you.

yuu (@findermao)
